We will first load the necessary libraries.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

# Problem 1

We load in and clean the transit data, updating variable names and
selecting the relevant columns. We designate our route variables as
character variables, and we convert the entry variable to a logical
variable using the `recode` function.

``` r
nyctransit = read_csv('data/NYC_Transit.csv', col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, starts_with('route'), entrance_type, entry, exit_only, vending, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, 'YES' = TRUE, 'NO' = FALSE))

head(nyctransit)
## # A tibble: 6 × 20
##   line  stati…¹ stati…² stati…³ route1 route2 route3 route4 route5 route6 route7
##   <chr> <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>  <chr>  <chr>  <chr>  <chr>  <chr>  <chr>

## 5 4 Av… 36th St    40.7   -74.0 N      R      <NA>   <NA>   <NA>   <NA>   <NA>  
## 6 4 Av… 45th St    40.6   -74.0 R      <NA>   <NA>   <NA>   <NA>   <NA>   <NA>  
## # … with 9 more variables: route8 <chr>, route9 <chr>, route10 <chr>,
## #   route11 <chr>, entrance_type <chr>, entry <lgl>, exit_only <chr>,
## #   vending <chr>, ada <lgl>, and abbreviated variable names ¹​station_name,
## #   ²​station_latitude, ³​station_longitude
```

Currently, this dataset contains the following variables: `line`,
`station_name`, `station_longitude`, `station_latitude`, `route`,
`entrance_type`, `entry`, `exit_only`, `vending`, `ada`. There are 1868
rows and 20 columns. These data are not currently tidy; the route number
and route name should be variables.

The following code chunk selects all stations identified by both name
and line then the `distinct` function is applied to identify the unique
stations. There are 465 distinct stations.

``` r
nyctransit %>%
  select(station_name, line) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  nrow()
## [1] 465
```

Using a similar strategy and applying the `filter` function, we can see
that 84 stations are ADA compliant.

``` r
nyctransit %>%
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>%
  select(station_name, line) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  nrow()
## [1] 84
```

To compute the proportion of station entrances / exits without vending
allow entrance, we filter for those that do not allow vending. Then, we
pull the `entry` variable; because this is a logical variable, taking
the mean will produce the desired proportion, which is approximately
0.38 rounded to 2 decimal points.

``` r
nyctransit %>%
  filter(vending == "NO") %>%
  pull(entry) %>%
  mean
## [1] 0.3770492
```

Now, we reformat the dataset so that route number and route name are
distinct variables by using the `pivot_longer` function to go from wide
to long format.

``` r
nyctransitreformat = 
  pivot_longer(
    nyctransit, 
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number",
    values_to = "route_name",
    names_prefix = 'route') 
```

Using a similar strategy as above, these are the code chunks used to
identify that 60 stations serve the A train and that 17 of these
stations are ADA compliant.

``` r
nyctransitreformat %>%
  filter(route_name == "A") %>%
  select(station_name, line) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  nrow()
## [1] 60

nyctransitreformat %>%
  filter(route_name == "A", ada == TRUE) %>%
  select(station_name, line) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  nrow()
## [1] 17
```

# Problem 2

We start with importing the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet from the excel file,
selecting the desired rows and columns. We clean the dataset by updating
variable names, omitting rows without dumpster-specific data, and round
the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converting this
result to an integer variable using `as.integer`. The same steps are
then applied to the Professor Trash Wheel sheet.

As a final step in both datasets, we add a variable named `id` to
identify each dumpster by the specific Trash Wheel and number. We then
combine both datasets to form a single tidy dataset named
`total_trashwheel` using the `bind_rows` function. We note a couple
important things:

-   We need to change the `year` variable in the `mr_trashwheel` dataset
    to a numeric variable to be consistent with the
    `mr_professor_trashwheel` dataset in order to carry out the
    `bind_rows` function.

-   The `mr_professor_trashwheel` dataset does not have the
    `sports_balls` variable and therefore contains `NA` values once we
    combine the datasets.

``` r
mr_trashwheel = read_excel('data/Trash_Wheel.xlsx', 
                                   sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", 
                                   range = 'A2:N550') %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year),
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls, digit = 0) %>%
      as.integer(),
    id = paste('mr', row_number(), sep = '_')) %>%
    relocate(id) 
```

``` r
professor_trashwheel = read_excel('data/Trash_Wheel.xlsx', 
                                   sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", 
                                   range = 'A2:M97') %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    id = paste('prof', row_number(), sep = '_')) %>%
    relocate(id) 
```

``` r
total_trashwheel = bind_rows(mr_trashwheel, professor_trashwheel)
head(total_trashwheel)

```

## Data Description

In the `total_trashweel` dataset, there are 641 observations of 15
variables related to litter collection for a dumpster at any given date.
547 observations come from the `mr_trashwheel` dataset, and 94
observations come from the `professor_trashwheel` dataset. We use the
`summary` function to obtain an overview of all the datasets; the
results are intentionally not displayed here to prevent cluttering. We
note that data from Mr. Trash Wheel originates back to 2014 through 2022
compared to Professor Trash Wheel, which reports data from 2017 through
2022.

``` r
summary(mr_trashwheel)
summary(professor_trashwheel)
summary(total_trashwheel)
```

These code chunks, using the `sum` and `pull` functions, were used to
obtain the following computations. The total weight of trash collected
by Professor Trash Wheel was 190.12 tons. The total number of sports
balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020 was 856. Of note, for the
sports balls calculation, we first filtered the `mr_trashwheel` dataset
for the year 2020 to create a 2020 specific dataset and then pulled the
sports balls data.

``` r
sum(pull(professor_trashwheel, weight_tons))
## [1] 190.12

mr_trashwheel2020 = filter(mr_trashwheel, year == 2020) 
sum(pull(mr_trashwheel2020, sports_balls))
## [1] 856
```

# Problem 3

First, we load and clean the data in polsmonth.csv. We update variable
names and use `separate` to break up the variable `mon` into integer
variables `year`, `month`, and `day`. We replace month number with month
name using `recode`, create a `president` variable taking values gop and
dem using the `recode` function, and remove the `prez_dem`, `prez_gop`,
and `day` variables. Of note, there are some observations in which
`prez_dem` took the value of 2; these were recoded as `NA`, as we could
not definitively categorize them as gop or dem. Finally, we arrange the
data so that `year` and `month` are the leading columns.

``` r
polsmonth = read_csv('data/fivethirtyeight_polsmonth.csv') %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(col = mon, into = c('year', 'month', 'day'), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year), 
    month = as.integer(month),
    day = as.integer(day),
    month = recode(month, '1' = "jan", '2' = "feb", '3' = "mar", '4' = "apr", '5' = "may", '6' = "jun", '7' = "jul", '8' = "aug", '9' = "sep", '10' = "oct", '11' = "nov", '12' = "dec"),
    president = recode(prez_gop, '1' = "gop", '0' = "dem")) %>%
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day) %>%
  arrange(year, month)
## Warning: Unreplaced values treated as NA as `.x` is not compatible.
## Please specify replacements exhaustively or supply `.default`.

head(polsmonth)
## # A tibble: 6 × 9

## 4  1947 feb        23      51     253      23      45     198 dem      
## 5  1947 jan        23      51     253      23      45     198 dem      
## 6  1947 jul        23      51     253      23      45     198 dem
```

Second, we load and clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process.
Of note, we first need to use the `as.Date` function here to specify the
date format then use the `separate` function as above.

``` r
snp = read_csv('data/fivethirtyeight_snp.csv') %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    date = as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>%
  separate(col = date, into = c('year', 'month', 'day'), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year), 
    month = as.integer(month),
    day = as.integer(day),
    month = recode(month, '1' = "jan", '2' = "feb", '3' = "mar", '4' = "apr", '5' = "may", '6' = "jun", '7' = "jul", '8' = "aug", '9' = "sep", '10' = "oct", '11' = "nov", '12' = "dec")) %>%
  select(-day) %>%
    arrange(year, month)

head(snp)
## # A tibble: 6 × 3
##    year month close
##   <int> <chr> <dbl>
## 1  1969 apr   104. 
## 2  1969 aug    95.5
## 3  1969 dec    92.1
## 4  1969 feb    98.1
## 5  1969 jan   103. 
## 6  1969 jul    91.8
```

Third, we tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets. We switch from wide to long format, ensuring that key
variables have the same names and that key variables take the same
values.

``` r
unemploy = read_csv('data/fivethirtyeight_unemployment.csv') %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year)) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemploy_percent") %>%
    arrange(year, month)

head(unemploy)
## # A tibble: 6 × 3
##    year month unemploy_percent
##   <int> <chr>            <dbl>
## 1  1948 apr                3.9
## 2  1948 aug                3.9
## 3  1948 dec                4  
## 4  1948 feb                3.8
## 5  1948 jan                3.4
## 6  1948 jul                3.6
```

We join the datasets by merging `snp` into `polsmonth`, and merging
`unemploy` into the result, using `year` and `month` as keys across
datasets. We decide to use the `left_join` function specifically so that
we retain all the data across datasets and do not lose any data due to
missing values, particularly as the `snp` and `unemploy` datasets are
not as complete as the `polsmonth` dataset. Depending on the type of
analyses we are interested in, we could use the `filter` function to
exclude rows lacking specific data.

``` r
pol_snp = left_join(polsmonth, snp, by = c("year", "month"))
unemploy_pol_snp = left_join(pol_snp, unemploy, by = c("year", "month"))

head(unemploy_pol_snp)
## # A tibble: 6 × 11
##    year month gov_gop sen_gop rep_gop gov_dem sen_dem rep_dem president close
##   <int> <chr>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>     <dbl>
## 1  1947 apr        23      51     253      23      45     198 dem          NA
## 2  1947 aug        23      51     253      23      45     198 dem          NA
## 3  1947 dec        24      51     253      23      45     198 dem          NA
## 4  1947 feb        23      51     253      23      45     198 dem          NA
## 5  1947 jan        23      51     253      23      45     198 dem          NA
## 6  1947 jul        23      51     253      23      45     198 dem          NA
## # … with 1 more variable: unemploy_percent <dbl>
```

## Data Description

`polsmonth` dataset: There are 822 observations for 9 variables related
to the number of national politicians who are democratic or republican
at any given time.

`snp` dataset: There are 787 observations for 3 variables related to the
closing values of the S&P stock index on the associated date.

`unemploy` dataset: There are 816 observations for 3 variables related
to the percentage of unemployment during the associated year.

The merged `unemploy_pol_snp` dataset contains 822 observations for 11
variables. We use the `summary` function to obtain an overview of this
merged dataset; the results are intentionally not displayed here to
prevent cluttering. This merged final dataset contains data from years
1947 to 2015 and reports all the data related to political parties, S&P
stock index, and unemployment percentages arranged by year and month.
